# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Status

This is a newly initialized repository with minimal content. As of the initial analysis:
- Only contains a README.md file with "# smartmemo"
- No source code, configuration files, or project structure exists yet
- Has two branches: `main` and `dev` (both identical)

## Development Setup

Since this is an empty repository, no build, test, or lint commands are currently available. When the project is initialized, this section should be updated with:
- Package manager commands (npm/yarn/pnpm)
- Build commands
- Test commands
- Linting and formatting commands
- Development server commands

## Architecture Overview

The project architecture has not been established yet. When development begins, this section should document:
- Technology stack choices
- Core architectural patterns
- Directory structure conventions
- Key modules and their responsibilities

## Getting Started

To begin development on this project:
1. Decide on the technology stack (e.g., Node.js, TypeScript, React, etc.)
2. Initialize the project with appropriate package manager
3. Set up basic project structure
4. Update this CLAUDE.md file with actual development information

## Notes

- This repository appears to be a "smart memo" application based on the name
- Both `main` and `dev` branches exist but contain identical content
